# Personal Website

This repository constitutes the website that is being created in order to show my projects and experience, essentially as a nice form of a portfolio or expanded resum√©. It also gave me good experience with the basics of web development using the React framework. There are two ways to access this website.

## Custom Domain
This is actually not done yet. If you want to see my website as it is meant to be seen at this time, then you'll have to set it up manually. This section will be updated when I have a URL for the website all ready to go.

## Downloading and Running
Doing this requires having <code>npm</code> set up on your computer. If you do not have this, you can find instructions on how to do so [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) using <code>nvm</code>. You can download a copy of the code from this page, open a terminal, navigate to the directory, and run the command <code>npm start</code>. After running for a couple minutes, it should open up a browser to <code>localhost:3000</code> (or another port depending on preferences) and allow you to navigate my website in a development build.
