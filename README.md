# Personal Website

This repository constitutes the website that is being created in order to show my projects and experience, essentially as a nice form of a portfolio or expanded resum√©. It also gave me good experience with the basics of web development using the React framework. There are two ways to access this website.

## On the Internet
This website is being temporarily hosted at [shiny-pie-29acae.netlify.app](https://shiny-pie-29acae.netlify.app) using Netlify. This section will be updated when a custom domain has been purchased and setup properly.

## Download and Run Locally
Doing this requires having <code>npm</code> set up on your computer. If you do not have this, you can find instructions on how to do so [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) using <code>nvm</code>. You can download a copy of the code from this page, open a terminal, navigate to the directory, and run the command <code>npm start</code> for a development build or <code>npm run build</code> for a production build. After running for a couple minutes, it should open up a browser to <code>localhost:3000</code> (or another port depending on preferences) and allow you to navigate around my website.
